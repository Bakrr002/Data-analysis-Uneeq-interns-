# Data-analysis-Uneeq-interns-

Completed during the Data Analysis Internship at UneeQ Interns (June 2025 batch â€“ Remote), this project focused on working with real-world datasets through practical, hands-on application of modern data analysis techniques. Key responsibilities included data cleaning and preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating visual insights to support decision-making. Using tools such as Python (with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) and Jupyter Notebooks, I developed interactive dashboards and concise visual reports that highlighted major trends and findings. This experience helped me enhance my skills in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data storytelling. Upon completion, I was awarded a Certificate of Completion recognizing my contributions and progress during the internship.
